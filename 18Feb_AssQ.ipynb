A programmer can make use of various API tools to make their program easier and simpler. Also, an API facilitates programmers with an efficient way to develop their software programs. Thus in simpler terms, an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with the necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user. \n",

We can create an API for an operating system, database system, hardware system, JavaScript file, or similar object-oriented files. Also, an API is similar to a GUI(Graphical User Interface) with one major difference. Unlike GUIs, an API helps software developers to access web tools while a GUI helps to make a program easier to understand by users. \n",
